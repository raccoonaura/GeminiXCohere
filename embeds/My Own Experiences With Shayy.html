However, Shayy&rsquo;s community is much bigger than mine, and their influence among the Undertale community made me too scared to release or say anything. I also didn&rsquo;t know who to talk to about this because of how high Shayy&rsquo;s reputation is. I felt that if I made any accusations or explanations, I would lose my job, and face an insane amount of backlash. Now that there have been more victims coming forward, I believe I feel far more secure in coming out about this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most people assume that the stuff we talked about were strictly business or content creation related, this is not the case. While we do talk about that stuff, Me and Shayy have had several explicit conversations. Including but not limited to flirting and sexual stuff. Before me and my gf started dating officially, Shayy was already flirting with them. This was mainly just the typical &ldquo;Queer-coded&rdquo; type of flirting where they would be like &ldquo;oh you&rsquo;re so cute&rdquo;. I feel like in the Queer community, these kinds of compliments are very common, so it wasn&rsquo;t really anything out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, as time had progressed on, Shayy got more and more sexual towards me and my gf, to the point where we couldn&rsquo;t get any other conversation with them without it turning into something sexual. I want to explain all of this in full detail in this document.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document will be separated into a bunch of different parts explaining all of my weird interactions with Shayy and how infuriating it was talking with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c13">My dynamic with Shayy</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friendship dynamic with Shayy is that while we do talk about business, we often do &ldquo;Queer-coded&rdquo; kind of flirting.

She had been already friends with Shayy, which had led her to believe that Shayy would be a good option to pick up more work. Her and I have been trying to get a house together for a while, which is why we&rsquo;ve been working so hard to get as much work as possible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">After contacting Shayy about making YouTube Shorts, they said yes. Everything was looking good and the YouTube Shorts were discussed to start uploading on July 1st this year. In order to create YouTube Shorts however, Ava needed a bunch of stuff from Shayy. She needed the raw scripts, the audio recordings, and any and all information about how they wanted the Shorts to look like. She needed complete and active communication with them. Leading up to the date of July 1st, despite her needing this stuff, Shayy wouldn&rsquo;t give her any of the material that she needed to start working. Which caused massive amounts of anxiety between both me and Ava of meeting the upload start date of July 1st. Ava begged Shayy FOR WEEKS to get the material she needed from them. She would sometimes get no response or very vague ones. Which led me to have an idea.</span></p><p class="c1 c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span>I often noticed that Shayy often responds very frequently to sexual related messages. Just based on stuff I&rsquo;ve heard from Ava and my own experiences. Neither of us knew how long it would take for Shayy to finally get the shit Ava needed, and there was barely any communication between them and her. So I had the idea of offering a picture of my boobs to them. My thought process was, &ldquo;okay they&rsquo;re really active and actually talk to me when sexual activity between us is present. If I offer a picture of my boobs to them, I wonder if they&rsquo;ll actually give Ava what she needs to make her </span><span>Shorts</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;.

When I got invited, I went through their follower list, and I saw so many of my fans from my own community following it. This lewd account had uncensored pictures of their penis, ass, among other things. I felt so incredibly creeped out because the people following it were members from our communities that would frequent mine and their chat. Especially because I&rsquo;ve tried my absolute hardest to make sure that my community does not know about my personal life. It screamed parasocial to me. They were inviting people from </span><span class="c14">THEIR FANBASE</span><span>&nbsp;to their personal lewd account that contained a massive amount of explicit pictures of themselves.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Their lewd account has since been deactivated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5">Us Flirting</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Once I sent the picture of my boobs to them, Shayy also got more and more open with flirting with me. I expressed that I was comfortable with it, because I was scared of their reaction if I said no. So it kept continuing. Most of my time flirting with them, it would just be me barking with Shayy trying to fluster me. I chose barking instead of giving any proper response because I didn&rsquo;t want to flirt in the first place, but I was so incredibly scared of just saying no. So I wanted to strike a middle ground. Just enough to not hurt their feelings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 209.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 209.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can see the intimidation in my messaging here. I just kept saying that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m far more freakier than you&rdquo; because I didn&rsquo;t want to reveal much to them. It was during this sequence of messaging, that they revealed that they are into hypnotism.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shayy tried switching it around, so that I would go along with their fetish instead of them just flirting with me. Basically wanting to make our flirting more than just me barking at anything they would give me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 240.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 240.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So when Shayy told me this was their fetish, and wanted me to take action on it, I tried my absolute hardest to put them off without directly saying no. You can tell from this screenshot how not into this I was, but Shayy kept doubling down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eventually they asked if I was &ldquo;having fun&rdquo; during the flirting. This is a perfectly okay thing to do normally, but the problem is HOW they asked this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 232.76px; height: 454.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 232.76px; height: 454.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was so uncomfortable with what was happening at this point. I didn&rsquo;t say yes initially, and I was scared to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; so I said &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;. Shayy then sent a hypnotism GIF. I then felt forced to say yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is not how you ask for consent and it only made me more intimidated to say no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 150.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 150.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Me talking about it to Enzo (Shayy&rsquo;s mod)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5">Why the mod team released their initial response (The WillyJ post)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">I have no idea if this is going to be covered in the information that will be released to the public. So I&rsquo;m going to write about it here so that people know why that initial WillyJ post was made, just in case it&rsquo;s not covered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the accusations were first relayed to Shayy, Shayy had an absolute terrible reaction to everything. They deleted the Owner role from their own server and went dark (black profile picture, that sorta thing) and left from the speedrunning community. This naturally raised a lot of questions because of the shit reaction from Shayy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WillyJ&rsquo;s post was an attempt at damage control from Shayy&rsquo;s reaction. However, they needed more time to release the information to the public. Especially because more and more details were still being released at the time of Shayy&rsquo;s reaction. The team needed more time to release the info, but they also needed to get ahead of Shayy and make sure that Shayy wouldn&rsquo;t try to make themselves seem like the victim in the situation. The mod team had good intentions, and it was never meant to be seen as purposeful drama. It was simply them just trying to do as much damage control as possible without jeopardizing the victims. They wouldn&rsquo;t have had to make the post to begin with if Shayy didn&rsquo;t have the reaction that they did. Yet another piece of proof that Shayy cannot take criticism.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5">Conclusion</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c5 c6"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">I think a lot of people had it worse than me at the end of the day. Just judging based off of everything. I&rsquo;m so incredibly sorry to anyone that has been affected by this, and once this information is finally released, I&rsquo;d imagine that more victims are going to come forward. This was a massive situation. Shayy had DM&rsquo;s open, and anyone that joined Frog Family (their Discord) were subject to Shayy&rsquo;s sexual actions. So I would not be surprised if there are plenty more victims that we simply don&rsquo;t know about yet. All collaborations I did with Shayy are going to be set as &ldquo;Unlisted&rdquo;. I never want to associate with them again.</span></p><p class="c1 c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span>If you have had any experiences like this with Shayy, there are a mountain of people that are willing to support you. You are not alone.</span></p></body></html>
